Continuing with the movie dataset. There was another table with ratings by users.

First, I needed to join the two tables. 

SELECT movies_table.movieId, movies_table.title, movies_table.genres, ratings_table.movieId, ratings_table.rating
FROM movies.movies AS movies_table
LEFT JOIN movies.ratings AS ratings_table
ON movies_table.movieId = ratings_table.movieId
LIMIT 2

Row	movieId	  title	          genres	movieId_1	rating	
1	  2669  Pork Chop Hill (1959) War    2669     3.0
2	  2669  Pork Chop Hill (1959) War    2669     4.0

One thing to note is the importance of understanding your dataset. 
Unfortunately, I made the mistake of not understading that this was ratings based on users.
I wanted to confirm by checking on the ratings table. 

Row	userId	movieId	rating
1	  384     2669    3.0
2	  422     2669    4.0
