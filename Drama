There are many good genres in movies I wonder what genre is used the most? Dataset is from the "Popular Movie Dataset."

I was able to use the COUNT and GROUP BY function so that I can see how many times these genres appear in the dataset. 

SELECT COUNT(genres) AS Number, genres 
FROM movies.movies
GROUP BY genres
LIMIT 5

Row	Number	genres	
1	 4        War
2	 12       Crime
3	 1053     Drama
4	 60       Action
5	 946      Comedy

I had some trouble finding the max Number since the Number column is an alias. 
I wonder if there is another way to be able to find the max given the COUNT function?
For now I used a subquery. 

SELECT MAX(Number)
FROM (SELECT COUNT(genres) AS Number, genres 
FROM movies.movies
GROUP BY genres)

Row	 f0_	
1	  1053

Then, I was able to use the WHERE function to find which genre gives me 1053. 

SELECT Number, genres
FROM (SELECT COUNT(genres) AS Number, genres 
FROM movies.movies
GROUP BY genres)
WHERE Number = 1053

Row	Number	genres	
1	 1053     Drama

Drama is the genre that appears the most in the dataset.
